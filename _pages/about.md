Hello! I am a scientist and engineer pursuing interdisciplinary research in biophysics, soft matter and composite materials, and complex systems. A common thread in my research is looking for the relation between the geometry and associated physics- especially of air/ hydrofoils, tyres, materials and microfluidic systems. I aim to develop technologies and tools to aid the study of the natural world around us, for engineering of biology and to build solutions to unmet societal needs.
