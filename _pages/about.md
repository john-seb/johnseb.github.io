Hello! I am a scientist and engineer interested in pursuing interdisciplinary research in biophysics, soft matter and composite materials, and complex systems. My research has been on developing experimental and computational methods to study the geometry of airfoils, deformation of tyres. I aim to develop methods and tools to aid the study of nature and to solve unmet global challenges.
