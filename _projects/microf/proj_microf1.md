I was fortunate to have worked with Prof Ranjith Kumar, in the Nano/ Microfluidics Research Lab from its inception. In fact, I was the only undergrad in the lab! This however, also meant that the project had to be as lean as possible.


Every mainstream microfluidic chip fabrication technology or method comes with a penalty of time or cost of machinery and material. The current method presented here showcases a very low cost and rapid fabrication method which uses commonly available, non-hazardous chemicals/ materials. The process being a direct fabrication method requires the production of the final geometry directly rather than ‘inverse’ or ‘negative’ images of the final channel geometry. Hence this rapid method may be developed and used for testing and validating researches, produce lab-on-a-chip devices or point-of-care disposable medical devices.
